for some reason you have to install fzf on your machine separately


stuff to do:
- add a way to surround with quotes
- completely remove telescope
- figure out how block visual mode editing works
- focus on the currently open file when opening easygit
- remove auto closing of parenthesis, brackets, etc
- when doing a search, sort the results alphabetically (and focus on the last one that was focused on )
